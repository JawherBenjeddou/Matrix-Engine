Open-source, high performance 2D game engine currently in development.


## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 to 2022 is recommended, Matrix Engine is  untested on other development environments whilst i'm focusing on a Windows build.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/JawherBenjeddou/Matrix-Engine`.

<ins>**2. Configuring the dependencies:**</ins>

## The Plan
The plan for Matrix Engine is: to create a powerful 2D/3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching myself game engine design and architecture and also game dev,I'm interested in learning how to create a game engine because I believe that gaining this level of expertise will not only empower me to develop my own custom game engines but also enhance my proficiency in using existing game engines .
*"Innovation doesn't thrive by avoiding the wheel,it thrives by evolving it, turning it into something even more remarkable."*
## Short term goals :
 - [x] Scene architecture,
 - [x] adding ECS,
 - [ ] implementing batch rendering ,
 - [ ] Adding audio,
 - [ ] adding physics,
 - [ ] making an interactive game .

## The Vision : 
I aim to make Matrix Engine a versatile tool capable of handling various game systems, fostering creativity, and providing a solid foundation for game development. My aspiration is to have Matrix Engine ready for an impressive showcase in the upcoming Ludum Dare on April 12th 2024, demonstrating its capabilities in diverse game scenarios.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, and join me on this exciting journey of game development and engine design! Let's build something extraordinary together.
