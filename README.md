## The Plan
The plan for Matrix Engine is: to create a powerful 2D/3D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching myself game engine design and architecture and also game dev,I'm interested in learning how to create a game engine because I believe that gaining this level of expertise will not only empower me to develop my own custom game engines but also enhance my proficiency in using existing game engines .
"Innovation doesn't thrive by avoiding the wheel,it thrives by evolving it, turning it into something even more remarkable."
## Short term goals :
 - [ ] implementing batch rendering ,
 - [ ] Adding audio,
 - [ ] adding physics,
 - [ ] making an interactive game based on the "mandela effect".
